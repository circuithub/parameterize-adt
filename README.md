parameterize-adt
================

The definition module for parameterized forms.

Note that this module is probably only useful if you'd like to use the constructor definitions independently in your library.
If `parameterize-form` or similar is availiable you can can obtain the constructors by simply calling `adt.constructors(require "parameterize-form")`.
